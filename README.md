# Neo

Neo (originally `neovalis`) is a C++ utility library designed to simplify common development tasks, allowing you to build applications more efficiently.

## Why Neo?

Developing C++ applications often involves repetitive or time-consuming tasks. Neo aims to streamline your workflow by providing a collection of well-tested utilities, letting you focus on the unique aspects of your project.

### Key Features

* **Rapid Application Development:** Accelerate your development process by leveraging pre-built solutions for common C++ challenges. Neo is particularly useful when you need to create functional applications with limited time.

* **`constexpr` Math & Vector Math:** Harness the power of compile-time computations. Neo provides robust `constexpr` implementations for various mathematical operations, including vector math, enabling highly optimized code and compile-time error checking.

* **JSON File Support:** Easily handle JSON data within your C++ applications. Neo offers intuitive and efficient utilities for parsing, generating, and manipulating JSON files, simplifying data exchange and configuration management.

* **TrueColor Terminal Output:** Enhance the user experience of your command-line applications with vibrant, colored text using `style stack`.
